# Playing-Card-Detector
Mask R-CNN implementation to detect playing cards

This project is done as a final project for my CSS 490-machine learning class I took at the University of Washington, Bothell during the Summer of 2019. The class was taught by Professor Dong Si.

This implementation is based on a tutorial by Jason Brownlee from Machine Learning Mastery.
